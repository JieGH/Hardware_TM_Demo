# Hardware Tsetlin Machine Demo
This repository will state multiple Tsetlin Machine demonstration on hardware based on FPGA and microcontroller. 

The project received great help from [Professor Alex Yakovlev](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/engineering/staff/profile/alexyakovlev.html#background), [Dr Rishad Shafik](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/engineering/staff/profile/rishadshafik.html#background), and [Adrian Wheeldon](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/engineering/staff/profile/adrianwheeldon.html#background) at [microSystems research group](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/engineering/research/eee/microsystems/) of Newcastle University.
